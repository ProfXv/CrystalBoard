# üîÆ CrystalBoard üé®

A crystal-clear, transparent canvas that floats above your desktop. CrystalBoard is a minimalist tool for quick sketches, notes, and annotations directly on your screen, designed to be intuitive and integrate seamlessly into your workflow with mouse-only controls.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Transparent Overlay**: Draw on a borderless, transparent window that floats over your other applications.
- **Mouse-Only Operation**: Designed from the ground up to be controlled entirely with a 3-button mouse and scroll wheel.
- **Scroll-Wheel Mode System**: Effortlessly cycle through tools and settings without moving your cursor.
- **On-the-Fly Adjustments**: Dynamically change color (Hue, Saturation, Value) and brush size.
- **Live Cursor Preview**: The cursor instantly reflects the current brush size and color.
- **Mode Indicator**: A temporary text indicator appears next to the cursor to show the current scroll mode and action.
- **Minimalist Settings Panel**: A clean, centered help panel that provides keybindings and stays out of the way.
