# CrystalBoard ðŸ”®

**A crystal-clear, transparent canvas that floats above your desktop.**

CrystalBoard is a simple yet elegant desktop application that provides a transparent drawing surface, allowing you to sketch, annotate, or doodle over any of your open windows. It's built with C++ and the Qt framework for a lightweight and responsive experience.

## Features

### Core Functionality
- **Transparent Canvas**: The main window is fully transparent, letting you see everything on your desktop underneath.
- **Smooth Drawing**: Use your mouse to draw fluid lines with ease.
- **Versatile Color Picker**: A dedicated widget with RGB sliders allows for precise color selection. The slider tracks dynamically update to show a pure color gradient.

### User Interaction
- **Simple Controls**:
    - `Left-click + Drag`: Draw on the canvas.
    - `Right-click`: Toggle the color picker.
    - `Mouse Wheel`: Undo/Redo your strokes.
    - `Esc Key`: Instantly close the application.
- **Custom Brush Cursor**: A circular cursor provides a real-time preview of your selected brush color and size.
