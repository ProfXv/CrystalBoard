# üîÆ CrystalBoard üé®

**A crystal-clear, transparent canvas that floats above your desktop.**

CrystalBoard is a simple yet elegant desktop application that provides a transparent drawing surface, allowing you to sketch, annotate, or doodle over any of your open windows. It's built with C++ and the Qt framework for a lightweight and responsive experience.

## Features

### Core Functionality
- **Transparent Canvas**: The main window is fully transparent, letting you see everything on your desktop underneath.
- **Versatile Drawing Tools**: Pen, Eraser, Line, Rectangle, and Circle.
- **Rich Color Picker**: A dedicated widget with RGB sliders allows for precise color selection.
- **Tool Selection Bar**: Quickly switch between available drawing tools from within the color picker view.

### Advanced Interaction Model
CrystalBoard uses a mode-based system for the mouse scroll wheel to provide powerful, context-aware controls without cluttering the interface.

- **Click Middle Button**: Cycles through the three available scroll modes:
    1.  **History Mode**: Scroll to Undo/Redo actions.
    2.  **Size Mode**: Scroll to adjust the brush/shape size.
    3.  **Tool Mode**: Scroll to switch between drawing tools.
- **Visual Feedback**: A temporary indicator appears next to the cursor, showing the current mode and the specific action being performed (e.g., "Size: 15", "Pen").

### All Controls

| Button | Action | Effect |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Left** | Click + Drag | Draw with the current tool. |
| **Middle** | Click | Cycle through scroll modes (History, Size, Tool). |
| | Double-click | **Exit the application.** |
| | Scroll | Use the currently active scroll mode. |
| **Right** | Click | Clear the entire canvas. |
| | Double-click | Toggle the Color Picker / Settings view. |
| **Keyboard**| `Esc` Key | Exit the application. |

### Prerequisites
- A modern C++ compiler (GCC, Clang, MSVC)
- CMake (>= 3.16)
- Qt 6 (Core, GUI, Widgets)

### Build Steps
```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
# git clone <repository-url>
# cd CrystalBoard

# 2. Create and navigate to the build directory
mkdir -p build && cd build

# 3. Configure the project with CMake
cmake ..

# 4. Compile the source code
make
```

### Installation (Optional)
To make the `CrystalBoard` command available system-wide, you can copy the compiled binary to a directory in your system's `PATH`. A common choice is `~/.local/bin`.

```bash
# This command assumes you are in the project's root directory
cp CrystalBoard ~/.local/bin/
```

### Run the Application
After a successful build, the executable will be located in the project's root directory. If you've performed the installation step, you can run it from anywhere.
```bash
# From the project root
./CrystalBoard

# Or from anywhere, if installed
CrystalBoard
```
